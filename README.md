## Text Similarity Analysis with Sentiment Labeling

This project is designed to perform text similarity analysis based on sentiment labeling using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes libraries such as spaCy, TextBlob, scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy to preprocess text data, extract sentiment labels, and calculate similarity scores between texts.

### Overview

The project performs the following tasks:
- Preprocesses text data including tokenization, stopword removal, and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
- Conducts sentiment analysis on the preprocessed text data.
- Calculates text similarity based on cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors of texts.
- Implements a threshold-based approach to determine text similarity, considering sentiment labels.

### Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- spacy
- textblob
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
